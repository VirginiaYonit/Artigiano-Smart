## Challenge  
I developed “Agent Artigiano”, a micro-AI agent tailored for small businesses.  
The agent uses the **Persona Pattern** to simulate expert reasoning (accounting, document handling, customer service) and relies on **modular tools** that can be updated by anyone — not just developers.

## Approach  
Repeatable processes, fewer errors, and greater autonomy for business owners.  
Business logic stays transparent: just update the document, not the code.  
The agent can be extended with new tools and features without starting from scratch.

## Outcome  
Agent Artigiano bridges the gap between “AI for big enterprises” and the **real needs of artisans and small businesses**.  
Leveraging the document-as-implementation pattern and modular tool design makes this solution **sustainable, flexible**, and always aligned with real-world priorities.

## 🔧 Extending Agent Artigiano — Example Tool: PDF Generator  
As part of the agent’s evolution, I developed an additional tool for small businesses:  

### 🗂️ AI Multi-Product PDF Generator – Bilingual Product Sheet Automation  
An automated system that creates professional product sheets in **Italian and English** from an Excel file.  
It combines Generative AI (text), image integration, and layout with **ReportLab**.

**Features:**
- 🔤 Description generation via LLMs  
- 🖼️ Product image support (with fallback if missing)  
- 🧾 Elegant layout using ReportLab  
- 🌍 Language switching logic  
- 📄 Multipage and batch-ready  
- 🧩 Fully modular and customizable  

**Use case:**  
This tool fits within the Agent Artigiano ecosystem as a specialized module for e-commerce or catalog-based businesses who need to **generate high-quality product communication** quickly, efficiently, and without technical skills.

> Coming soon: direct integration with the Agent interface for “on-demand PDF generation”.

## Why it matters  
Based on agent design best practices — the “MATE” principles (Model, Action, Token, Environment).  
Fully customizable for any business sector, no technical lock-in.  
Simple to update: business logic lives in human-readable documents, not in code.
