## Challenge
I developed “Agent Artigiano”, a micro-AI agent tailored for small businesses. The agent uses the Persona Pattern to simulate real expert reasoning (accounting, document handling, customer service) and relies on modular tools that can be updated by anyone, not just developers.

## Approach
Repeatable processes, fewer errors, and greater autonomy for business owners. Business logic stays transparent: just update the document, not the code. The agent can be extended with new tools and features without starting from scratch.

## Outcome
Agent Artigiano bridges the gap between “AI for big enterprises” and the real needs of artisans and small businesses. Leveraging the document-as-implementation pattern and modular tool design makes this solution sustainable, flexible, and always aligned with real-world priorities.

## Why it matters

Based on agent design best practices (the “MATE” principles: Model, Action, Token, Environment)-
Fully customizable for any business sector, no technical lock-in
Simple to update: business logic lives in human-readable documents, not in code
